1. We can route static files without declaring routes, this is beacuse json data is not being passed to the page.

//Create server
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
//set port
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('server up in 3000');
});

//Inlcude the path module from node.
const path = require('path');
//this is routed to a public directory, any file in their can be served in the broswer if the file name is specified.
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../public')));

//Here is how we would get to the help.html page from the route above
//inside public we have a file named help.html
http://localhost:3000/help.html
